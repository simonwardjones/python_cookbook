"""Python metadata tricks

This module contains quick recipes to add metadata information to files,
so they can be easily summarised, ie: latest version, contents, ways of generating
or ways of using it.

Example:
    shortDescription = 'CatBoost model'
    fileComments     = '''This file includes a catboost model to predict the number of coffees that the Data Science team consumes in a week'''
    fileGeneration   = 'File generated with ' + os.path.abspath(__file__) + '(the script)'
    fileDirections   = '''This pickle file will get loaded as a dataframe of size ''' + \
    str(model.shape) + \
    '''. Read this data with utils.readPickleFile(current_model);'''
    filePath = current_model

    saveMetadata(filePath, shortDescription, fileComments, \
        fileGeneration, fileDirections)
